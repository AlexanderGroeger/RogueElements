Before writing generation code:
-Create a new class GenContext that implements from IGenContext

Code to generate a map:
-Instantiate a MapGen<GenContext>.
-Add a few GenPriority<GenStep<MapGenContext>> to its GenStep list.

-A common order of GenSteps would be:
1. InitGridPlanStep: Initializes a grid of rooms (A GridPlan).
2. A child of GridPathStartStep: Creates the shape of the path of rooms in the grid.
3. DrawGridToFloorStep: Turns the grid into a list of freehand rooms on a plane (A FloorPlan).
4. DrawFloorToTileStep: Draws the list of freehand rooms onto the actual map tiles.
5. StairsStep: For adding an up and down stairs to your map.
--This is considered the bare minimum needed for a map.--
6. PerlinWaterStep: For generating water patterns on your map using Perlin Noise.
7. A child of BaseSpawnStep: For distributing items, enemies, traps, etc. across the floor in specified patterns.

-After all this is done, call MapGen.GenMap(ulong seed) with the seed of your choice.
-Your map is now complete.
